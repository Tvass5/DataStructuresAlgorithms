# DataStructuresAlgorithms

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For this project we are were creating a software that would give the science advisor of ABC Universtity (ABCU) access to course information for students. This software would allow the advisors to search for and print out course and prerequisite information for a specific course.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

When developing the software I started out by documenting everything that ABCU required from the program. Once I had all the software requirements mapped out I then broke the project up into segments. After I broke the project up into sections I began looking over the pros and cons of the different data structures to see which data structure would be most suitable for solving the project. Once the data structure was choosen I moved on to creating the pseudocode for each segment and then creeating the code.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

While completing this project I overcame raodblocks by doing research. I was able to find examples or information from sites like stackoverflow, zybooks and many more.
I was also able to look back on previous assignments that I had turned in throughout the term in order to get a better idea of where to start and how to complete the project.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on this project has taught me how to tackle large projects in a way that I wouldn't become too overwhelmed. It has also shown me how to effectively utilize data structures and algortihms and how to apply effectively apply them to different codes.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project has taught me the importance of writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. It has given me a chance to get more practice on writing code that is easy to write and understand, through the use of annotations. I have always been told the importance of annotating your code, however actually completing the software and having to ensure that it was annotated properly has definitely shown me how much easier my code was to follow and understand and how much more pleasing my code looked.
