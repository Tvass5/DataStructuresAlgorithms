# DataStructuresAlgorithms

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For this project we are were creating a software that would give the science advisor of ABC Universtity (ABCU) access to course information for students. This software would allow the advisors to search for and print out course and prerequisite information for a specific course.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

When developing the software I started out by documenting everything that ABCU required from the program. Once I had all the software requirements mapped out I then broke the project up into segments. After I broke the project up into sections I began looking over the pros and cons of the different data structures to see which data structure would be most suitable for solving the project. Once the data structure was choosen I moved on to creating the pseudocode for each segment and then creeating the code.
